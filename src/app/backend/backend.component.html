        <b><i>Backend Development</i></b>
         is a process where a Person or Developer has an ability to develop server side of an Web Application.
          who performs task such as connecting and managing server and database  etc.
             <ul>
                    <li>Writing code using <b><i>javascript, PHP ,python,java etc</i></b>.</li>
                    <li>frameworks <b><i>django and flask for python,Rails, Larvel , Spring , Express</i></b> and uses as per client request.</li>
                    <li>They  creates connectivity between website or an Application with  database also manages it. </li>
             </ul>
             <p>So, as mentioned above person or developer who has knowledge of these skills such as 
                 <i> connecting and managing server and database using different Programming languages and frameworks such as 
                     <i>javascript , PHP , python ,java  and  django and flask for python,Rails, Larvel , Spring , Express frameworks </i> 
                     is called as 
                     <b>Backend developer</b>.</i></p>

    <h3><i>PHP</i></h3>

    <p><b><i>php</i></b>
     is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.
      It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
       The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
       PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
        but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

        PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented 
        as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
         On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – 
         which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML
          or binary image data – would form the whole or part of
           an HTTP response. Various web template systems, 
           web content management systems, and web frameworks
            exist which can be employed to orchestrate 
            or facilitate the generation of that response. 
            Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming
             tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications 
             and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>

    <div id="img">

    </div>
    <p>
    <b><i>java</i></b> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. </p>

    <h3><i>Python</i></h3>
    <div id="img">

</div>
<p>
    <b><i>Python</i></b> is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.</p>
    <p>Django and Flask are, by a wide margin, the most popular Python web development frameworks

        Django is a Python web framework that offers an open-source, high-level framework that “encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” It’s fast, secure, and scalable. Django offers strong community support and detailed documentation.
        
        Django is incredibly flexible in which you can work with MVPs to larger companies. For some perspective, some of the largest companies that use Django are Instagram, Dropbox, Pinterest, and Spotify.
        
        Flask is considered a microframework, which is a minimalistic web framework. It’s less “batteries-included,” meaning that it lacks a lot of features and functionality that full-stack frameworks like Django offer, such as a web template engine, account authorization, and authentication.
        
        Flask is minimalistic and lightweight, meaning that you add extensions and libraries that you need as you code without automatically being provided with it by the framework.
        
        The philosophy behind Flask is that it gives only the components you need to build an app so that you have the flexibility and control.
        
        Flask is also a prevalent and powerful web framework as it’s used by large companies like Netflix, Linkedin, and Uber.</p>

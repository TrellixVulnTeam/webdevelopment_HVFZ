      <h3><i>Webdevelopment</i></h3>
      <img  id="fs1" src="../../assets/image/home1.jpg" alt="Webdevelopment"  ><b><i>Webdevelopment</i></b> is the work
      involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network)
      . Web development can range from developing
       a simple single static page of plain text to
        complex web applications, electronic businesses, and 
        social network services. A more comprehensive
         list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers,
          may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
           client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server
            and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            <p>
              Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main 
              non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.
               Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
                changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web 
            development teams can consist of hundreds of 
            people (Web developers) and follow standard methods
             like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent
              or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related 
              job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
               technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between
                departments rather than the domain of a designated department.There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: 
                 front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
                  Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals 
                  that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><i>FRONT END - </i></b>

“Front End” typically refers to what
 you actually see on the website in the browser 
 (and is often called “client-side”). 
 This means that front end developers are responsible
  for everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet,
   from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders.

   
</p>
<h6><b>Skills needed:</b> JavaScript,
  HTML, CSS, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Ajax,
   UI (User interface), UX (user experience),
    JavaScript Frameworks such as  Angular-s, Angular.js, ReactJS, vue.js, Ember.js and Meteor.js.</h6>
<p>

<b><i>BACK END - </i></b>

While the front end is everything the user
 interacts with directly, “Back End” typically refers to the guts 
 of the application which live on the server
  (and is often called “server-side”). 
   The back end of a website consists of a server, 
   an application, and a database. Back end developers 
   generally work with front end developers to make their
    code work within the site’s design (or to tweak that design when necessary) and user interface.

 
 </p>
 <h6><b>Skills needed:</b> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, SQL, Java, Linux, Python, Ruby, PHP.</h6>
 <p>

<b><i>FULL STACK - </i></b>

Full Stack web development is a
 combination of both the front-end and back-end. 
 “Stack,” means layer in this case.
  A full-stack web developer has expertise in
   all layers of a website’s development.
    This includes, 
    but not limited to: the server, 
    client and hosting, a
     form of data structuring or modeling,
      user interface and experience, as well as the needs of the actual business.

  <p><b>Practical Web development</b>
    In practice, many Web developers will have basic interdisciplinary skills / roles, including:
    
    Graphic design / Web design
    Information architecture and copywriting/copyediting with Web usability, accessibility and search engine optimization in mind
    Mobile responsiveness
    Testing
    <h2> Software testing</h2> 
    Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. The extent of testing varies greatly between organizations, developers, and individual sites or applications.
    <p>
    Security considerations
    Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption. Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of Web development as a whole. Scripts can be used to exploit Web sites by granting unauthorized access to malicious users that try to collect information such as email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers. Some of this is dependent on the server environment on which the scripting language, such as ASP, JSP, PHP, Python, Perl or Ruby is running, and therefore is not necessarily down to the Web developer themselves to maintain. However, stringent testing of Web applications before public release is encouraged to prevent such exploits from occurring. If some contact form is provided on a Web site it should include a captcha field in it which prevents computer programs from automatically filling forms and also mail spamming.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because new security holes are found in Web applications even after testing and launch, security patch updates are frequent for widely used applications. It is often the job of Web developers to keep applications up to date as security patches are released and new security concerns are discovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keeping a Web server safe from intrusion is often called Server Port Hardening. Many technologies come into play to keep information on the Internet safe when it is transmitted from one location to another. For instance TLS certificates (or "SSL certificates") are issued by certificate authorities to help prevent Internet fraud. Many developers often employ different forms of encryption when transmitting and storing sensitive information. A basic understanding of information technology security concerns is often part of a Web developer's knowledge.
